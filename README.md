# Colorometric Chemical Sensing
A system (built on the nRF51) that measures the concentration of chemical biomarkers in urine/blood through colorometric sensing. The goal is to build a sensor that accurately and repeatably translates a color curve (produced by a chemical reaction, E.G. ELISA assay) into the concentration of the target particle.  The system uses RGB LEDs and photodiodes to monitor the color curves, and estimate the particle concentration.
